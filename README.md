# Inspirit-AI-Deep-Drive-Designing-DL-Systems-Notebooks

This repository contains all the mini-projects I worked on during the duration of the Deep Dives Program. Some of the notebooks were completed with instructor help on the day of the lecture, and the notebooks pertaining to GANs and COVID Web Scraping were completed by me. 

Acknowledgements: I would like to thank Ayush Pandit(Current computer science Ph.D student at Stanford) and Mr. Kuan Chuen Wu(Current lead data scientist at CatapultX) for their guidance in helping me complete these projects.
